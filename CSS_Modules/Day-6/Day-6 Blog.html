        <h2>Ip Address</h2>
        <p>An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device that connects to a network, such as the internet. It allows devices to communicate with each other by ensuring that data sent over the network reaches the correct destination.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="Server">
        <h2>Server</h2>
        <p>A server is a specialized computer or software system that provides services, resources, or data to other computers, known as clients, over a network. The relationship between a server and its clients is referred to as the client-server model.</p>
        <p>In simpler terms, a server is like a digital "storehouse" where data is stored, and it serves (or "delivers") that data to other computers or devices that request it.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="Domain">
        <h2>Domain</h2>
        <p> In the context of the internet, a domain refers to a human-readable address that points to a specific website, service, or server. It's part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites and services online.</p>
        <p>A domain name acts as a user-friendly address for accessing resources on the internet. For example, when you type www.example.com in your web browser, the domain name example.com is translated into an IP address, which leads you to the website's server.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="DNS">
        <h2>DNS</h2>
        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system that translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) that computers use to identify each other on the internet. DNS functions as the "phonebook" of the internet, allowing users to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names instead of having to remember numerical IP addresses.</p>
